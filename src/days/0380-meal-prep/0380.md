You're organizing a family meal. Given a list of dishes and their respective preparation times, return the minimum number of hours required to prepare all dishes if you can cook up to two dishes simultaneously. If a dish takes longer than the remaining time of the current hour, it will be moved to the next hour.


Examples:

// Using number of minutes for prep time

mealPrep([120])
2 // one single long dish

mealPrep([30, 30, 30, 20])
1 // multiple shorter dishes

mealPrep([30, 25, 45, 30, 60, 15])
2 // many dishes with varying times
