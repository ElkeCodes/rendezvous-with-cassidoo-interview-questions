https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/if-you-spend-too-much-time-thinking-about-a-thing/

Given an array of random integers, move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array. Try to keep this in O(n) time (or better)!

Example:

$ moveZeros([1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 6])
$ [1, 2, 1, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0]
