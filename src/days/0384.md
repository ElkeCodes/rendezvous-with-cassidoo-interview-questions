At the Magic Cookie Factory, cookies are baked in factorial quantities. A cookie is "perfectly round" if its size ends with a zero. Write a function to determine how many perfectly round cookies will be made when baking with n! ingredients.

Examples:

countPerfectlyRoundCookies(5)
1 // 5! = 120, which has 1 trailing zero

countPerfectlyRoundCookies(10)
2 // 10! has 2 trailing zeros

countPerfectlyRoundCookies(100)
